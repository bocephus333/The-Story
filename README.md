# The-Story
This is a program to playfully teach myself more about the BASH language. 

I want to create for myself an experience driven base line of knowledge to better educate myself on the best practices of bash.
I welcome any and all recommendations that are well explained and well thought out all the while keeping in mind
that I am learning in chunks.
